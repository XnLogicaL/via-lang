## Code Style

- Use **modern C++** (C++20 and later).
- Avoid raw memory management at all costs.
- Prefer in-house abstractions where applicable.
- Follow existing conventions:
  - Follow the [Format Guidelines](./.clang-format).
  - Use `snake_case` for variables and functions.
  - Use `PascalCase` for classes and types.
  - Use `LOUD_SNAKE_CASE` for macros.
  - Use spaces instead of tabs when indenting.
  - Be consistent with changes.
  - Keep headers light and self-contained.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Open a draft PR early if unsure â€” discussion is welcome.
- Keep PRs focused and minimal. One feature/fix per PR is ideal.
- Include comments for complex logic.
- If you add a new feature, add a minimal test case if possible.

---

## Reporting Issues

- Use the [Issues](https://github.com/XnLogicaL/via-lang/issues) tab.
- Include:
  - What you expected vs. what happened
  - Minimal reproducible example
  - Version/commit hash if possible
