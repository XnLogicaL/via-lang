# Overview

The via Programming Language is an bytecode-interpreted scripting language. It has static and optionally-infered typing, context free grammar. It implements multiple paradigms, mainly [OOP]() and [FP]().

## Motivation

The main purpose behind via is to make a Lua that appeals to people who enjoy the benefits of static typing and other features like metaprogramming, of which are completely impossible to achieve with Lua.

## Influences

As said previously, via is primarily inspired by [The Lua Programming Language](). It shares many internal similarities with said language. On the other end of the language, via's syntax is inspired by other interpreted languages such as [Java]() and/or [TypeScript]().
